# README PalmSens Cloud-hub

The **PalmSens Cloud-hub** is a Proof of Concept of a device that can send measured data from a measurement instrument to the cloud. It has the potential to replace wired measurements by wireless measurements together with the implementation of a cloud environment.

The hub has been programmed with Python on a Raspberry Pi. The primary functions are:

 1. Receiving measured data
 2. Parsing measured data
 3. Storing data locally
 4. Displaying data
 5. Sending data to the cloud
 6. Displaying statuses (USB connection, Cloud connection, etc.)

## AnyDesk
AnyDesk is a tool that has been used to provide online access to the Raspberry Pi from anywhere. The tool can display what is happening on the RPi without the need of an external monitor, mouse or keyboard.

To receive access to the RPi via AnyDesk:

 - Access adress: 

> 890573770

 - Access code: 

> palmsens

## Setup

 1. Download Anydesk and log in with the credentials seen above.
 2. Open the following folder on the RPi: /home/pi/Cloud-Hub/PalmSens CloudHub/Firmware/MethodSCRIPT_CloudHub 
 3. Open the following two files: *CloudHub[OFFICIAL]* and *displayUI* 
 4. Press Run button in *CloudHub[OFFICIAL]* to run a retreiving of measurement
 5. Press Run button in *displayUI* to run the UI of the cloud-hub
